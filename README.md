CoffeeEngine
===========

This project is simply a learning tool for DirectX11.  It is a very simplistic 3d engine.

* NOTE: Most of the DirectX11, Direct3d code comes directly from the RasterTek samples.

Windows Compilation
-----------

This project requires Windows 7, DirectX11, and Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.
DirectX11 cannot be developed on a Windows operating system prior to Windows 7.

* Download and install the [DirectX11 SDK] (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812).

Mac & Linux Compilation
-----------

This is an incomplete section and a pull request for this section would be accepted.

* NOTE: All System classes must be derived from the interface (pure abstract class) 'CoffeeEngine::Interfaces::ISystem.'

OpenGL
-----------

This is an incomplete section that will be developed at a later time.

* NOTE: All Graphics classes must be derived from the interface (abstract class) 'CoffeeEngine::Graphics::BaseGraphicsClass.'
